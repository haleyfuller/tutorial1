# tutorial1

For Patterns 1 Homework...
I wasn't able to get the added behaviors to work. I have the code written, but it isnt communicating correctly with the other classes. 
I added the earth material to the sphere and made it rotate.


For Tutorial3...
I added coins that would increase a tank's health.
The tank could collide with a coin and their tank health would improve by 50 points (Total health is 100 points)
With each new round called, the coins are replaced.
